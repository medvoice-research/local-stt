I'm Lucas I'm the TOEFL expert at magoosh.com and in this video you're going to get some listening practice that's just like listening on the real TOEFL but first let me introduce you to the listening section so you know what to expect you're going to see or hear three recordings this is a full set on the TOEFL listening but on a real TOEFL you'll have two sets with six recordings altogether period rewind and listen again just listen once and take notes because after every recording you're going to see questions five or six multiple choice questions meaning A B C or D write your answer as the question is on the screen similar to the real test you'll have about 30 seconds per question so we will keep that question on the screen in the video for about 30 seconds and in that time you should write down your answer your notes from what you heard before and then you'll see the next question at the end of all three recordings with all of their questions you'll see the answers so you can grade your answers and find out which ones you got right and which ones you got wrong so you can learn from your mistakes and know how to improve before test okay so let's get started you're going to hear the First Recording next and then the first set of questions and after that the second recording with the second set of questions Etc now listen to a conversation between a student and a professor so Aaron in your email you said you wanted to talk about the exam I've just never taken a class with so many different readings I've managed to keep up with all the assignments but I'm not sure how to how to how to review everything yeah and other classes I've had there's usually just one book period some videos well developmental psychology is a little more involved compared to some other subjects you've looked at the study guide I assumed kind of yes I mean I haven't gone through the whole thing yet I'm still just doing the stuff on the first page you haven't looked at the second page of the study guide at all yet know I've barely had time to go back over the first two readings from the first page well no wonder you're so confused about where to start let me show you a copy of the study guide look here see what it says at the top of the page this first page is just a list of all the texts and videos that'll be on the test the actual guide is on the second page see oh wow and it says what I need to remember from eating so for example from the intro to adolescent psychology book you only need to review the developmental stages from chapter 2 and it looks like I need to know everything from the main textbook the big one right you want to review all the Core Concepts in the first four chapters of development through lifespan well almost all I forgot to mention this on the study guide but the test won't really go into Freud stages of development those are a little outdated compared to newer research but we're still going over all of Piaget's developmental stages for children right exactly and notice that you only need to review about half of the supplemental readings just the ones that focus on adult psychological development and the video on Alzheimer's disease the brain disorder and elderly people see I marked it right here okay I feel like I understand a lot better now I I guess I should have looked at the second page huh yeah and I actually did mention that in class you know you really should have checked with your classmates before coming to me well I've always studied alone before I don't think students should be studying Solo in any class it's always better to study with partner or a group it can really help avoid confusion yeah I really had trouble keeping up in class so far I think I'll join the class study group in the library tonight yeah please do your classmates can probably help you more than I could you know when it comes to organizing your notes getting together a good study strategy that sort of thing why does the student visit her professor why does the student think reviewing for the test is hard in her psychology OK Google what is the professor's attitude towards study groups what does the professor imply the students should do if she has any more questions about the listen again to part of the conversation then answer the question and notice that you only need to review about half of the supplemental readings just the ones that focus on adult psychological development and the video on Alzheimer's disease the brain disorder and elderly people see I marked it right here why does the professor say this and the video on Alzheimer's disease the brain disorder and elderly people see I marked it right here listen to part of a lecture in a geology class you'll recall that soil erosion is a process where soil is worn away over time we've looked at the ways the wind can move soil pull it apart and blow it away now I'm going to tell you about some of the ways that rain water Kenny Road soil remember soil is very loose gets very soft when it's wet so water can have a real impact there are a few different types of soil erosion caused by rain water behaves a little differently for each type of Ocean and the effects are different for some contacts let's consider bank erosion first this kind of wearing a way of the soil happens along the banks of rivers and streams hence the name the soil nearest to the water loosens up and starts to wash away plants growing in the soil come loose too grass bushes even trees can eventually fall into running water if you look at the edge of a river you can notice this the way that the land along the river seems to hang out over the water with the current under the edge of the land this is because the soil beneath the bank has been eaten away the effects of this are pretty clear I'm sure you can all picture it well enough the first significant stage of rain over ocean is a bit harder to spot we call it sheet erosion this process happens more slowly it'll happen on land that slowed it in One Direction or another is gravity pulls rain down a slope the rain grabs some soil takes it along for the ride Hills will seem more Sandy than level ground because they've lost some of their soil to sheet erosion but this effect happens even on land that's just a little tilted it just happens more slowly it can take years to really make a difference but eventually it really does very gradually rain will strip away the soil and pull it to the bottom of the slope and the higher land will become Sandy plants will start to struggle and die off sheet erosion really only happens on slopes that are smooth so that the rain water flows in one big sheet flows evenly across the whole slope this doesn't really leave room for that bank erosion I mentioned earlier it's just an initial stage but once the slope is a little more bumpy with even soil erosion will happen less evenly too when it rains water will naturally flow through the lowest smoothest path on the slope it'll flow around the bumps in other words and form tiny streams I mean not real streams just little Paths of flowing rainwater these flows are called reels soil from the higher parts of the land can get washed into the real a little but most of the erosion happens to the soil that's directly in the reels path this soil gets washed away to lower ground and the real erosion makes a Sandy path through the surrounding dirty you can see even when it's not raining reals can change the shape of an open surface as the soils pushed forward big lumps of it can form in the real and not move all the way down the slope so the real will have new front bumps to flow around the next time it rains a real can change its path completely eventually on the other hand sometimes it doesn't change all that much just goes along pretty much the same path every time it rains reels can get really deep if that happens widening at the same time via the bank erosion process I mentioned earlier they can develop into a more dramatic group that's all sand and no soil kind of looks like a dry River bed a big real like that is called a Gully Gully erosion can really mess up a piece of land pull the soil away from the land and large strips so that big pieces of land are no longer plant friendly at all there are actually more types but it's these that will need to understand the process the progression land made when soil is left vulnerable to the effects of Farmland between harvests deforested expanses unless they're covered and protected the soil will start moving what aspect of water erosion does the lecture focus on according to the lecture what are the physical effects of bank erosion choose 2 answers according to the professor what is the effect of sheet erosion on plant life what can be inferred about how reals are formed when does Gully erosion happen listen again to part of the lecture then answer the question Hills will see more Sandy than level ground because they have lost some of their soil to sheet erosion but this is a lot that's just a little tilted it just happens more slowly it can take years to really make a difference but eventually it really does what does the professor imply when she says this it can take years to really make a difference but eventually it really does listen to part of a lecture in a physics class so we obviously know that gravity causes things to fall to the ground and stay there controls causes the time at least all the same obvious now but for the previous time gravity was a mystery to scientists it took thousands of years for scientists all around the world to work out how the different effects are connected how this invisible force does its thing Susie you have a question yeah I mean thousands of years I thought Newton didn't discover gravity until like the 1700s that's less than a thousand years ago 1600s actually but I'm glad you brought him up Newton is important he's kind of the opposite of the first gravity scientist though Newton actually finalized much of what we know about gravity what it actually does a lot of scientists looked at gravity before he did there were the Ancients like Aristotle the ancient Greek philosopher he believed every object had and this is why a feather wouldn't fall slower than a stone Aristotle would say it had less gravity inside it less than the rock did Rodger it looks like you have something to say didn't Aristotle also think that some things fell up I mean instead of falling down that's a very good point Rodger yes well it's a very confusing idea period what direction they fell in so to Aristotle the Earth was the center of the universe and he believed most things in the universe had a gravity that naturally pulled them to the center to the ground but Aristotle believed that certain other things had different natural places for example fire Aristotle I thought that Flames pointed upward because the natural place for a flame was up in the air above the Earth but below the Moon is that what you are getting at Rodger yeah I guess I just thought Aristotle thought Flames kept going up and up and up no Aristotle thought the Flames would stop at some point at their natural place in the sky but I can understand how you'd be confused Aristotle's ideas seemed odd to us today now there was another early scientist whose idea is on gravity may seem more familiar and ancient Indian thinker from the 500 Brahma Gupta that was his name he believed that the Earth was basically a giant ball that was full of gravity and pull things down to it so around Earth with its own gravitational pull just like we believe today now yes Susie sorry I'm confused again I thought nobody knew the Earth was round until people sailed all the way around the world in in like the 14 or 1500 how did Brahma Gupta figure out the world was round well actually Susie the theory the world is round is a very old one in fact it was during Aristotle's life that some of his fellow Greek scientist realized the Earth had to be around in many ways this idea of a round Earth was the first step toward our modern understanding of gravity and Brahma Gupta took that a step further realizing there was gravity within the sphere of the earth now Aristotle was write 2 in a sense things can fall at different speeds but that's because of differences in air resistance the atmosphere or counteracting when it hits things that are not so compact not not dents Aristotle brahmagupta other ancient thinkers were missing an important Theory well a fact I'm talking about heliocentrism the idea of the earth isn't the center of the universe that it revolves around the Sun that idea became popular much later in the 1500s does anyone know who Copernicus is Rodger he said the Earth revolves around the Sun but didn't he get in trouble for that didn't the church make him stop saying it well he wasn't punished but he did get a lot of grief from religious leaders at the time the idea certainly wasn't traditional but other scientists and the public they embraced his ideas about planetary orbits this new scientific attention to orbits set the stage for Newton to realize that do I have any made things fall to the Earth but they also made the moon circle the Earth and then Newton figured out what we all know now larger objects have gravitational power over smaller ones what aspect of gravitational science is the lecture mainly about according to the professor what two important things did the Indian science realize about the Earth how did Copernicus is study of planetary orbits help scientists understand gravity listen again to part of the lecture then answer the question yeah I guess I just thought Aristotle thought Flames kept going up and up and up no Aristotle thought the Flames would stop at some at their natural place in the sky but I can understand how you'd be confused Aristotle's ideas seemed odd to us today why does the professor say this Aristotle's ideas seemed odd to us today then answer the question in fact it was during some of his fellow Greek scientist realized the Earth had to be around in many ways this video of a round Earth was the first step toward our modern understanding of gravity what does the professor imply when he says this in fact it was during Aristotle's life that some of his fellow Greek scientists realized the Earth had to be round match each gravitational Theory below to the scientist who held the theory for answers explanations and help scoring go to TOEFL dot

a list of all the texts and videos that'll be on the test the actual guide is on the second page see oh wow and it says what I need to remember from eating so for example from the intro to adolescent

wet so water can have a real impact there are a few different types of soil erosion caused by rain water behaves a little differently for each type of Ocean and the effects are different for some

rain over ocean is a bit harder to spot we call it sheet erosion this process happens more slowly it'll happen on land that slowed it in One Direction or another is gravity pulls rain down a slope the rain grabs some soil takes it along for the ride Hills will seem more Sandy than level ground because they've lost some of their soil to sheet erosion but this effect happens even on land that's just a little tilted it just happens more slowly it can take years to really make a difference but eventually it really does\"),\n"," Document(metadata={}, page_content=\"happens more slowly it can take years to really make a difference but eventually it really does very gradually rain will strip away the soil and pull it to the bottom of the slope and the higher land will become Sandy plants will start to struggle and die off sheet erosion really only happens on slopes that are smooth so that the rain water flows in one big sheet flows evenly across the whole slope this doesn't really leave room for that bank erosion I mentioned earlier it's just an initial stage but once the slope is a little more bumpy with even soil erosion will happen less evenly too when it rains water will naturally flow through the lowest smoothest path on the slope it'll flow around the bumps in other words and form tiny streams I mean not real streams just little Paths of flowing rainwater these

move all the way down the slope so the real will have new front bumps to flow around the next time it rains a real can change its path completely eventually on the other hand sometimes it doesn't change all that much just goes along pretty much the same path every time it rains reels can get really deep if that happens widening at the same time via the bank erosion process I mentioned earlier

now but for the previous time gravity was a mystery to scientists it took thousands of years for scientists all around the world to work out how the different effects are connected how this invisible force does its thing Susie you have a question yeah I mean thousands of years I thought Newton didn't discover gravity until like the 1700s that's less than a thousand years ago 1600s actually but I'm

less than the rock did Rodger it looks like you have something to say didn't Aristotle also think that some things fell up I mean instead of falling down that's a very good point Rodger yes well it's a very confusing idea period what direction they fell in so to Aristotle the Earth was the center of the universe and he believed most things in the universe had a gravity that naturally pulled them

natural place in the sky but I can understand how you'd be confused Aristotle's ideas seemed odd to us today now there was another early scientist whose idea is on gravity may seem more familiar and ancient Indian thinker from the 500 Brahma Gupta that was his name he believed that the Earth was basically a giant ball that was full of gravity and pull things down to it so around Earth with its

idea of a round Earth was the first step toward our modern understanding of gravity and Brahma Gupta took that a step further realizing there was gravity within the sphere of the earth now Aristotle was write 2 in a sense things can fall at different speeds but that's because of differences in air resistance the atmosphere or counteracting when it hits things that are not so compact not not dents

get a lot of grief from religious leaders at the time the idea certainly wasn't traditional but other scientists and the public they embraced his ideas about planetary orbits this new scientific attention to orbits set the stage for Newton to realize that do I have any made things fall to the Earth but they also made the moon circle the Earth and then Newton figured out what we all know now
